# The `git` Low
For those who say I do not know how to use git to `git push`, and `git add`, and `git commit --amend` ... I actually do know how to do this, but my build is broken, as MacOS has their only git, and has take over my git. I can do everything but push to github, for fear of sending my entire Mac OS to git, which, by the way, I know I can `.gitignore` a lot of files. I am not using it as an excuse, but, as long as you know why I have simply `git commit`ed these small changes here and there, it because I can not access github via git, which means I can not use `git commit --amend` to make the small changes without creating a huge backlog of history.

So, for now, I will be keeping my files and .git on my local, and will upload what and when I choose to.

### Do you `git` it yet?
