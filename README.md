# About Shift n Scroll for Mac

This mod is very small, and very simple. Shift n Scroll for Mac makes Shift Scrolling on Mac accessible in Minecraft again.

*   This was made with Forge 1.16.4.35.1.29. Once I can figure out how to allow it to be used with previous versions of forge, I will update it.
*   I believe that someone can also very easily switch this to fabric, if someone would like to message me, we can collab.
*   It is Client Side only, as in, nothing about it needs the server to run. The scroll event is still handled by forge, so all SELECTED things will not change.

_I have tested it with ATM6, 1.3.9b, and it works fine, with 246 mods installed in 1.3.9b._

### Where to Do ...:

### Known Bugs:

*   ~~Gui Scrolling not working, in inventory screens, etc.~~ Fixed in 0.0.0.s2
